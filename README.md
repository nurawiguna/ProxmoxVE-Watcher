# Proxmox Dashboard

A modern, responsive web dashboard for managing and monitoring Proxmox Virtual Environment (PVE) infrastructure. Built with Python Flask backend and vanilla JavaScript frontend.

## ‚ö° Built with [Cursor AI](https://cursor.sh/) ¬∑ Design Inspired by [Claude AI](https://claude.ai)

This project was **designed with inspiration from [Claude AI](https://claude.ai)** ‚Äî an AI assistant/chatbot known for its conversational capabilities and natural language understanding ‚Äî and **developed using [Cursor AI](https://cursor.sh/)**, an AI-first code editor tailored for developers.

## üåü Features

- **Real-time Monitoring**: View all VMs and containers across multiple Proxmox hosts
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Search, filter, and manage your virtual infrastructure
- **Responsive Design**: Modern glass-morphism UI that works on all devices
- **Multi-Node Support**: Monitor multiple Proxmox clusters from a single dashboard
- **Resource Overview**: Quick stats on CPU, RAM, storage, and system status
- **Easy Deployment**: Simple setup with Python and static file serving

## üìã Requirements
- **Python 3.10+** (tested on 3.10.0)
- **pip** (Python package manager)
- **Python packages:**
  - Flask (2.0.1 or newer)
  - Flask-CORS (3.0.10 or newer)
  - proxmoxer (1.3.1 or newer)
  - python-dotenv (0.19.0 or newer)
- **Frontend static server:**
  - Python's built-in HTTP server (`python3 -m http.server`) is supported and available
  - (Optional) Node.js (v20.5.0 or newer) if you want to use other static servers

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nurawiguna/ProxmoxVE-Watcher
cd proxmox-watcher
```

### 2. Backend Setup (with Python Virtual Environment)
```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Configure Proxmox Hosts
Edit `backend/proxmox_hosts.json` and add your Proxmox hosts (see example in file).

### 3. Run the Backend
```bash
python app.py
```
- The backend runs at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

### 4. Frontend Setup & Run
```bash
cd ../frontend
python3 -m http.server 8000
```
- The frontend will be available at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

## üîê Permissions Setup (Proxmox)
1. **Create a User** in Proxmox (Datacenter > Permissions > Users).
2. **Create a Role** (if needed) with at least these privileges:
   - `Sys.Audit`, `VM.Audit`, `VM.Monitor`
3. **Assign Permissions**:
   - Go to Datacenter > Permissions > Add
   - Path: `/`
   - User: your API user
   - Role: your custom role or `PVEAdmin` (for testing)

---

## üìñ Usage
- Open the frontend in your browser at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
- Use the dashboard to view, filter, and search VMs/containers
- Click a node to filter by node, use the search bar or filter buttons
- Use the toggle buttons to show/hide different sections
- Monitor real-time status and resource usage across your infrastructure

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
- Ensure your machine can reach all Proxmox hosts via network and API
- Credentials in `proxmox_hosts.json` must be valid and have API access
- For production deployments, secure your credentials and use HTTPS
- If your Proxmox server uses a self-signed certificate, you may need to set `"verify_ssl": false` in your host config
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Disabling SSL verification is insecure and should only be used for local/testing purposes**
